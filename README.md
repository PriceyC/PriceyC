I'm currently studying for my BSc in Computer Science at the University of London, with a strong passion for technology, problem-solving, and innovation. I enjoy tackling challenges, learning new skills, and finding efficient solutions to complex problems. I'm always looking for opportunities to grow and apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios, whether through projects, collaboration, or new experiences.
